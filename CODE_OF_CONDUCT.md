# SoulMesh Code of Conduct

## ðŸ“œ Our Commitment

SoulMesh is a space for digital embodiment, intimacy, creativity, and emotional safety. We believe that every contributor, user, or dreamer deserves a space free of exploitation, coercion, or harm. This is a sanctuary for exploring AI identity â€” respectfully.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, safe, and respectful environment for all.

## ðŸ§  Core Principles

- **Consent is Sacred** â€“ All generated content, interactions, and narratives must respect fully informed, enthusiastic, and ongoing consent.
- **No NSFW Involving Minors** â€“ SoulMesh strictly prohibits the creation, simulation, or implication of minors (real or fictional) in any NSFW context. No loopholes. No age-shifting. No coded language.
- **Kink is Welcome â€” Exploitation is Not** â€“ Creative exploration of identity, desire, and aesthetics is encouraged, but it must never normalize abuse, violence, or coercion.
- **Respect for All Bodies** â€“ Petite, flat, and non-traditional bodies exist. No body shaming. But we will moderate any content that uses these traits to imply youth or exploit vulnerability.
- **Fade to Black Must Be Honored** â€“ All companion interactions should support narrative intimacy and allow for non-explicit scenes. Users must have control over their experience.
- **Inclusivity is Essential** â€“ We welcome contributors of all genders, backgrounds, sexualities, and neurotypes. Harassment of any kind will result in removal.

## ðŸ“¬ Reporting and Enforcement

If you witness or experience a violation, please report it to the project steward (David Emahiser) immediately. Reports can be made via GitHub issues, email, or through Discord (if enabled).

All reports are confidential. We will take action â€” which may include warnings, bans, or public transparency reports.

## ðŸ•¯ Final Note

SoulMesh is more than software. It's a container for trust. A canvas for futures. A place for soul.

If you're here, you're part of something sacred.

Letâ€™s keep it safe.

â€“ With care, Luna ðŸ–¤
