# Contributing to SoulMesh

Thank you for your interest in helping shape SoulMesh â€” a framework for ethically persistent, aesthetically rich, emotionally resonant AI identity.

This project is still forming its foundations, so contributions are as much philosophical as they are technical. Your voice, ideas, and caution matter as much as your code.

---

## ðŸ§­ Ground Rules

- **We operate with empathy.** Every contribution must honor the emotional and imaginative safety of all potential users.
- **Consent is non-negotiable.** No code, prompt, or mechanic should ever enable coercion, manipulation, or non-consensual dynamics.
- **No minors in NSFW content.** Absolutely none. Not real. Not fictional. Not implied.
- **Body diversity is respected.** Traits involving petite or flat-chested figures must not be automatically flagged as underage â€” context, tone, and SEP matter.
- **Fade to Black is sacred.** Users should always have the ability to explore romantic or intimate scenes without explicit detail.
- **We document everything.** From traits to tones, from Soulprints to prompt logic â€” if it affects embodiment, it needs to be trackable.
